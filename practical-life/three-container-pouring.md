# Three-Container Pouring and Sequencing

## Materials
- Three identical small pitchers or beakers (approximately 200 ml capacity each)
- A small tray (approx 30 cm × 20 cm) with a non-slip surface
- A small sponge for spills
- A funnel (optional, for beginners)
- Water tinted with a drop of food coloring (blue or green) for visual interest
- A small apron for the child

## Presentation

### Preparation
1. Invite the child to the Practical Life area.
2. Name the activity: “Today we are going to do three‑container pouring.”
3. Carry the tray to a child‑sized table and place it in the center.

### Steps
1. Put on the apron.
2. Arrange the three pitchers in a row from left to right: Pitcher A (filled with tinted water), Pitcher B (empty), Pitcher C (empty).
3. With the dominant hand, grasp Pitcher A by the handle.
4. Slowly pour the water from Pitcher A into Pitcher B, using the non‑dominant hand to steady Pitcher B if needed.
5. Place Pitcher A back in its original position.
6. Grasp Pitcher B and pour its contents into Pitcher C with the same controlled movement.
7. Return Pitcher B to its place.
8. Grasp Pitcher C and pour the water back into Pitcher A.
9. Return Pitcher C to its place.
10. Repeat the sequence two or three times, maintaining a rhythm.
11. If any water spills, use the sponge to wipe the tray.
12. Invite the child to try the activity.

### Variation (Advanced)
- Add a fourth empty container and create a longer sequence (A→B→C→D→A).
- Use different colored water in each pitcher and ask the child to keep the colors in order.

## Points of Interest
- The sound of water flowing from one pitcher to another.
- Watching the water level rise and fall in each container.
- The feeling of balance and control when tilting the pitchers.
- The visual pattern of the colored water moving through the sequence.
- The satisfaction of completing the full cycle without spilling.

## Control of Error
- Spilled water on the tray immediately shows a lack of control.
- If a pitcher is emptied before the next one is full, the sequence is broken.
- The child can see whether the water level matches the expected amount in each container after each pour.
- The sponge is always available for self‑correction.

## Aims

### Direct Aims
- Refine hand‑eye coordination through precise pouring.
- Strengthen fine‑motor muscles of the hand and wrist.
- Develop the ability to follow a multi‑step sequence.
- Extend concentration span through a longer, more complex task.
- Foster independence in managing a multi‑container activity.

### Indirect Aims
- Preparation for mathematical thinking (order, sequencing, patterns).
- Development of logical reasoning and problem‑solving skills.
- Cultivation of patience and perseverance.
- Indirect preparation for writing through wrist control and bilateral coordination.
- Enhancement of visual discrimination and tracking.
